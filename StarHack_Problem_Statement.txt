YouMatter Gamification Challenge
About YouMatter:
YouMatter is a comprehensive mobile wellness platform that empowers users to take control
of their Health, Wealth, and Financial Wellness through integrated digital solutions. The app
combines health tracking with insurance services to create a holistic wellness ecosystem.

Primary Objective:
Design and develop innovative gamification modules that will significantly enhance user
engagement, increase Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU), and drive
organic app downloads for the YouMatter platform.
Key Performance Indicators:
•

Increase DAU by 40% through engaging daily interactions

•

Drive organic downloads by 50% through viral and social features

•

Improve feature adoption by 60% across all wellness categories

Problem Areas to Address:
User Engagement Challenges
1. Feature Discovery Gap: Users utilize very few features on application ( Policy
Servicing, Aktivo constitute for 60% of total used features)
2. Motivation Decline: Initial enthusiasm drops.
3. Passive Interaction: No user-generated content and peer engagement
